## Useful laws of the land

From a [very interesting blog post](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-laws-of-the-land/):

* Okrent’s law: The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true.
* Yerkes-Dodson law: Performance increases with anxiety and excitement, but only to a point.
* Vierordt’s law: We underestimate long periods of time and overestimate short periods of time.
* Cunningham’s law: The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question. It’s to post the wrong answer.
* Parkinson’s law of triviality: The amount of attention a problem gets is the inverse of its importance.
* Chekhov’s gun: Remove everything from writing that doesn’t need to be there.
* Campbell’s law: Social measures of performance distort the performance of the thing you’re measuring.
* Benford’s law of controversy: Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.
